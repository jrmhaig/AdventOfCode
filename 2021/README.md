# Advent of Code 2021

For [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) I decided to try
answering each each with an object oriented solution utilizing, where possible,
design patterns. Generally these are the patterns documented in
[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
and the main purpose is to try to understand them better myself. I am not an
expert but a colleague at work suggested that I could write notes for anyone
else who might find this useful. To this end I have started adding README files
with each solution. These notes are mainly about the patterns used rather than
solutions to the puzzles, which have already been amply covered in various
places across the internet.

All these examples require Ruby >= 3.0.
