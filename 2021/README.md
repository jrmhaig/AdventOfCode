# Advent of Code 2021

For [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) I decided to try
answering each each with an object oriented solution utilizing, where possible,
design patterns. Generally these are the patterns documented in
[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
and the main purpose is to try to understand them better myself. I am not an
expert but a colleague at work suggested that I could write notes for anyone
else who might find this useful. To this end I have started adding README files
with each solution.
